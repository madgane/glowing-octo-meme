The complexity of the \ac{JSFRA} algorithm scales quickly with the number of sub-channels, since the complexity of the interior point method, which is used to solve the problem, increases with the problem size. Thus, we can use the decomposition methods presented in \cite{palomar2006tutorial,boyd2011distributed} to overcome this complexity by designing precoders for each sub-channels independently with minimal information exchange.

As an alternative sub-optimal solution, we present a \acl{QM} \ac{SRA}, which solves for the precoders using \ac{JSFRA} formulation for a specific sub-channel \me{i} with a fixed transmit power \me{P_{\max,i}}. The sharing of power can be equal or based on a predetermined pattern as in partial frequency reuse for the sub-channels as given by
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^N P_{\max,i} = P_{\max}.
\end{equation}
Even though \me{N} sub-channels are present at any given scheduling instant, precoders are computed for each sub-channel in a sequential manner with the sub-channel specific total power constraint \me{P_{\max,i}} and the number of backlogged packets. Let \me{Q_{k,i}} be the number of backlogged packets associated with user \me{k} before solving for the precoders specific to the sub-channel \me{i}. Since the precoder design is sequential, \textit{i.e}, the precoders are designed for sub-channels \me{[0,i-1]} before \me{\ith{i}} sub-channel, the number of backlogged packets for the initial sub-channel is initialized as \me{Q_{k,1} = Q_k}. The queues associated with the consecutive sub-channels are given by
\begin{equation}	\label{eqn-weight}
	Q_{k,i+1} = \max \Big ( Q_k - \sum_{j = 1}^{i} \, \sum_{l = 1}^{L} \, t_{l,k,j} ,0 \Big ) \; \forall \; k \in \mathcal{U}
\end{equation}
where \me{t_{l,k,j}} denotes the rate corresponding to the user \me{k} on the \me{\ith{j}} sub-channel and \me{\ith{l}} spatial stream. \review{In spite of the improved covergence speed over the \ac{JSFRA} approach, the \ac{SRA} scheme is sensitive to the order in which the sub-channels are selected. Heuristically, we can choose the order by sorting the available best channel norm from each sub-channel, obtained by sorting the norm of the channel between the users and the corresponding serving \ac{BS} for each sub-channel. In spite of not considering the number of backlogged packets in the sub-channel ordering, it can be preferred over random ordering. However, as the number of users in the system increases, the \ac{SRA} scheme will be insensitive to the sub-channel ordering due to the multi-user diversity.}
