In this paper, we addressed the allocation of space-frequency resources to the users in a multi-cell \ac{MIMO} \ac{OFDM} system. The resource allocation is considered as a joint space-frequency precoder design problem since the allocation of a resource to a user can be achieved by a non-zero precoding vector. We proposed the \ac{JSFRA} scheme by adopting the \ac{SCA} technique to model the nonconvex constraint as a sequence of convex subsets to design the precoders for minimizing the number of queued packets. Additionally, an alternative approach using \ac{MSE} relaxation is also proposed with the same objective by fixing the receivers based on \ac{MSE} minimization. We also proposed the distributed solutions for the centralized \ac{JSFRA} problem using primal and \ac{ADMM} decomposition methods. Finally, we proposed an iterative algorithm to determine the precoders in a decentralized manner based on the \ac{KKT} conditions for the \ac{MSE} reformulated \ac{JSFRA} scheme. Numerical results shows that the proposed algorithms perform better than the existing approaches.
