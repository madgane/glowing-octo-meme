In this work, we presented the \acl{QM} objective to minimize the number of backlogged packets by designing the transmit precoders across the space-frequency dimension in a multi-cell \ac{MU} \ac{MIMO} system. We proposed the \ac{JSFRA} scheme, which adopts the \ac{SCA} technique to model the nonconvex constraint as a convex constraint in an iterative manner to design the precoders for the \acl{QM} objective. We also proposed an alternative approach using the \ac{MSE} relaxation for the same problem when the receive beamformers are based on the \ac{MMSE} receivers. The exponent used in the proposed formulation can be modified to achieve either greedy allocation or equally fair allocation. We also proposed the distributed solutions for the proposed centralized \ac{JSFRA} problem using the \ac{ADMM} method, which has better convergence behavior compared to the primal decomposition. In addition, we also proposed an iterative algorithm based on the \ac{KKT} conditions for the \ac{MSE} reformulated \ac{JSFRA} scheme to design the precoders in a distributed manner using the closed form solutions.
