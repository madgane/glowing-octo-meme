The distributed algorithms are compared using the total number of backlogged packets after each \ac{SCA} update. Fig. \ref{fig-d} compares the performances of the algorithms with the \ac{PL} varies uniformly between \me{[0,-6]} dB and each \ac{BS} serves \me{|\mc{U}_b| = 4} users. As discussed in Section \ref{sec-4}, the performance and the convergence speed of the distributed algorithms are susceptible to the step size \eqn{\rho^{(i)}}. Due to the fixed interference levels in the primal approach, it may lead to infeasible solutions if the initial or any intermediate update is not feasible.

Fig. \ref{fig-d} compares the performance of the \ac{JSFRA} schemes discussed in Sections \ref{sec-3.2.1} and \ref{sec-3.3} using primal and \ac{ADMM} approaches. For each \ac{SCA} update, the primal or the \ac{ADMM} scheme is performed for \me{J_{\max} = 20} iterations to exchange the respective coupling variables. The number of backlogged packets only at the \ac{SCA} points are marked in the figure. The performance of the distributed approaches is similar to that of the centralized schemes if the distributed algorithms are allowed converge. However, in our simulations, we observe that \eqn{J_{\max} = 20} is sufficient for the \ac{ADMM} to converge. 

%In Fig. \ref{fig-d}, the total number of backlogged packets at each \ac{SCA} points are plotted without the inner loop iterations of \me{J_{\max}} times for the primal or the dual variables convergence. %It can be seen from Fig. \ref{fig-d} that the distributed algorithms approach the centralized scheme by exchanging minimal information between the coordinating \acp{BS}.

Fig. \ref{fig-d-3.1} compares the performances of the centralized and the \ac{KKT} algorithm in Section \ref{sec-4.3} for different exponents with \ac{PL} chosen uniformly between \me{[0,-3]} dB. The \me{\ell_1} norm \ac{JSFRA} scheme performs better over other schemes due to the greedy nature of the objective. The \ac{KKT} approach for \me{\ell_1} norm is not defined due to the non-differentiability of the objective as discussed in Section \ref{sec-4.3}. If used for \me{\ell_1} norm, the over-allocation will not affect the dual variables \me{\sigma_{l,k,n}} and \me{\alpha_{l,k,n}} since the queue deviation is raised to the power zero in \eqref{kkt-mse-4.2}. A heuristic method is proposed in Fig. \ref{fig-d-3.1} by assigning zero for \me{\sigma_{l,k,n}} when \me{Q_k - t_k < 0} to addresses the over-allocation. The heuristic approach oscillates near the converging point with the deviation determined by the factor \me{\rho} used in \eqref{kkt-mse-4.1}. The objective values are mentioned in the legend for all the schemes and the \me{\ell_1} norm is used for comparison.

\begin{comment}
The \me{\ell_2} norm for the \ac{JSFRA} and the \ac{KKT} approach achieves nearly the same value of \me{6.62} with different \me{\chi}, due to the limited number of iterations for the dual variable convergence between each \ac{SCA} update. Fig. \ref{fig-d-3.1} also shows the effect of dropping the squared rate variable from the objective in the \ac{Q-WSRME} scheme compared to the \me{\ell_2} norm which includes it. By dropping it, the \ac{Q-WSRME} scheme minimizes the number of queued packets in a prioritized manner based on the respective queues. On contrary, the \me{\ell_2} norm allocate rates to the users with the higher number of queued packets before addressing the users with the smaller number of queued packets.

In Fig. \ref{fig-d-2}, the performance of the distributed algorithms are studied for \me{K = 12} users utilizing \me{N = 6} sub-channels. The system considers \me{N_B = 3} \acp{BS}, each having \me{N_T = 4} transmit antennas serving \me{|\mc{U}_b| = 4} users equipped with \me{N_R = 2} antennas respectively. The users are assumed to have the path loss following the uniform distribution between \me{[0,-6]} dB from all \acp{BS}. The performance of the algorithms are similar to the \me{N_B = 2} \ac{BS} scenario discussed earlier.

Fig. \ref{fig-d-2} plots the performance of the centralized and the distributed algorithms at each \ac{SCA} update. In case of the distributed approaches, in between each \ac{SCA} update, the primal or the \ac{ADMM} exchanges are performed for \me{J_{\max} = 20} iterations. In practice, \me{J_{\max} = 1} can be set to perform the \ac{SCA} update, \ac{ADMM} or primal update, and the receive beamformers \me{\mvec{W}{k,n}} update at the same instant, which affects the convergence rate and the stationary point of the final solution. The data tips are used to highlight the convergent points of various algorithms. The performance of the \ac{JSFRA} schemes using the primal decomposition are notably inferior compared to the \ac{ADMM} approach for the same schemes. It is mainly attributed to the difficulty in selecting the step size for the system employing \me{N_B \geq 3} \acp{BS}.
