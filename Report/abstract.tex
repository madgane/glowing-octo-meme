We consider a multi-cell \ac{MIMO} \ac{OFDM} system with \ac{MU} contending for the space-frequency resources in the downlink direction. The problem is to determine the transmit precoders by the \acp{BS} in a coordinated manner to minimize the total number of backlogged packets in the \acp{BS}, which are destined for the users in the system. Since the problem is similar to the precoder design for a \ac{MIMO} \ac{IBC} system, traditionally it is solved by the \ac{WSRM} objective with the number of backlogged packets as the corresponding weights, \textit{i.e}, longer the queue size, higher the priority. In contrast, we address the queue minimizing downlink precoder design as a joint nonconvex optimization problem over space-frequency resources. We employ \ac{SCA} technique to solve the problem by a sequence of convex subproblems using inner approximations. Initially, we discuss the centralized \ac{JSFRA} solutions based on \ac{SCA} as well as by \ac{MSE} reformulation. Then we extend the distributed precoder design for the centralized schemes using primal and \ac{ADMM} method. Finally, we discuss the distributed precoder design problem by solving the \ac{KKT} expressions to obtain the closed form solutions for the transmit and the receive precoders. Numerical results are shown to compare them.
