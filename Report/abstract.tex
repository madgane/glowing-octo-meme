The paper considers coordinated multi-cell \ac{MU-MIMO} transmission using \ac{OFDM} technique for downlink channels. Linear beamforming and receiving are employed at BS and corresponding users, respectively. The design criterion is to minimize the number of queued packets, since the transmission is mainly guided by the backlogged packets. An indirect way to solve this problem is to associate the weights of the traditional weighted sum rate maximization scheme with the current  status of the queue size, i.e., the longer queue, the higher priority. We deal with this problem directly by formulating it as a noncovex optimization problem and then applying a sequential convex approximation method to find beamformers.  In particular, we propose an efficient resource allocation scheme based on jointly optimizing beamformers over the space and frequency domain. We refer to this scheme as \ac{QM} \ac{JSFRA} scheme. The proposed solutions are compared to the traditional \ac{Q-WSRM} approaches mentioned above in terms of the rate of convergence and the backlogged packets remaining after a scheduling instant.
