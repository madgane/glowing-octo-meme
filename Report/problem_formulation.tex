
The problem defined in \eqref{q_gen_sum} ignores the second order term arising from the Lyapunov drift minimization objective by the limiting it to a constant term. It can be seen that \eqref{eqn-4.2} provides similar expression when the exponent is set to be \me{q=2} as
\begin{equation}\label{pf-1}
\underset{t_k}{\text{minimize}} \, \sum_k \, v_k^2 = \underset{t_k}{\text{minimize}} \, \sum_k \, Q_k^2 - 2 \, Q_k t_k + t_k^2.
\end{equation}
It can seen that \eqref{pf-1} is equivalent to the \eqref{backpreassure} algorithm when we ignore the second order terms from \eqref{pf-1}. It can be seen that by dropping the second order term from the \ac{Q-WSRM} formulation, we require an explicit rate constraint \eqref{eqn-3.1.4} to limit the allocations beyond the respective user requirements. In the current queue deviation formulation, the explicit rate constraint is not needed, since it is handled by the objective function itself. Since the objective is to minimize the number of queued packets, the sub-channels are coupled in this formulation as compared to the traditional \ac{WSRM} objective eventhough the interference from the adjacent sub-channels are zero (due to the \ac{OFDM} scheme). The queue deviation objective provides an alternate and more complete way to perform the resource allocation as compared to the \eqref{q_gen_sum} approach.

Before proceeding further, we note that the constraint in \eqref{eqn-4.2} is handled implicitly by the definition of the \me{q}-norm in the objective of \eqref{eqn-3}. As a proof, suppose that \me{t_k>Q_k} for a certain \me{k} at optimum, i.e., \me{-{v}_k=t_k-Q_k>0}. Then there exists \me{\delta_k>0} such that \me{-{v}^{\prime}_k=t^{\prime}_k-Q_k<-{v}_k} where \me{t^{\prime}_k=t_k-\delta_k}. Since \me{\|\tilde{\mbf{v}}\|_q=\| |\tilde{\mbf{v}}| \|_q=\||-\tilde{\mbf{v}}|\|_q}, this means that the newly created vector \me{\mbf{t}^{\prime}} achieves a smaller objective which contradicts with the fact that an optimal solution has been obtained. We comment on the choice of  the norm \me{q} on the objective as below \cite{berry2004cross,qps_cioffi}.
\begin{itemize}
\item With \me{q = 1}, the objective results in greedy allocation \textit{i.e}, emptying the queue of users with good channel condition before considering the users with worse channel conditions. As a special case, it is easy to see that \eqref{eqn-3} reduces to the \ac{WSRM} problem \eqref{gen_sum} when the queue size is large enough for all users.
\item With \me{q = 2}, the objective prioritizes users with higher number of queued packets before considering the users with a smaller number of backlogged packets. For example, it could be more ideal for the delay limited scenario when the packet arrival rates of the users are similar, since the backlogged packets is proportional to the delay in the transmission following the Little's law \cite{neely2010stochastic}.
\item With \(q = \infty \), the objective minimizes the maximum number of queued packets among users with the current transmission, thereby providing queue fairness by allocating the resources proportional to the number of backlogged packets.
\end{itemize}
