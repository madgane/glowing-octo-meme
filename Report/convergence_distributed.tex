The convergence of the \ac{ADMM} method follows the same argument as the centralized algorithm if each distributed algorithm is allowed to converge to a stationary value for the fixed \ac{SCA} point. Since the subproblem solved at each \ac{BS} is convex, the \ac{ADMM} method converges to a stationary point \cite{boyd2011distributed} for the fixed \ac{SCA} value. The receive beamformers are updated along with the \ac{SCA} update of \me{\tilde{\mbf{u}}_{l,k,n}}. Combining the receiver update with the \ac{SCA} update improves the convergence speed due to the fact that the \ac{MMSE} receivers are optimal for the fixed transmit beamformers, providing monotonic increase in the objective function.
