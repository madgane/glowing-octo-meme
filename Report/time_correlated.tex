We discuss the performance of the \ac{JSFRA} algorithm for different \me{\ell_q} over multiple transmission slots. It is compared with the existing \ac{Q-WSRME} scheme by varying the average arrival rate \me{A_k} of all users. Fig. \ref{fig-time-analysis} plots the performance of the centralized algorithms for different \me{\ell_q} values. Even though \me{A_k}'s are constant for all users, the instantaneous arrivals are random and it follows Poisson process. We considered a \me{4 \times 1} \ac{MIMO} system with \me{N = 4} sub-channels and \me{N_B = 2} \acp{BS}. The \ac{PL} is modeled as a uniform random variable \me{[0,-3]} dB.

Fig. \subref*{fig-review} compares various schemes with the average number of backlogged packets present in the system after each transmission slot. The performance of the \ac{JSFRA} scheme using \me{\ell_2} and \ac{Q-WSRME} approach are similar in the average number of residual packets after each transmission slot. Note that the additional rate constraints in the \ac{Q-WSRME} scheme is the reason for the equivalence. Both \ac{Q-WSRM} and \ac{Q-WSRME} performs similar to \me{\ell_2} \ac{JSFRA} scheme when the arrival rates are greater than the actual transmissions. Fig. \subref*{fig-review} and Fig. \subref*{fig-review-time} shows that the number of backlogged packets are noticeably less for the \me{\ell_1} \ac{JSFRA} scheme due to the greedy allocation of serving users with better channel. Fig. \ref{fig-time-analysis} highlights the \me{\ell_{\infty}} \ac{JSFRA} scheme performs equally good compared to other objectives when the system is in the stable region. On contrary, in the unstable region, the performance is inferior, since the fair allocation is not effective when the number of backlogged packets is significantly more for all users.
