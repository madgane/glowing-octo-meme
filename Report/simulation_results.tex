
In this section, we discuss the performance of the centralized algorithms from Section \ref{sec-3} for a few system configurations. To begin with, we consider a single cell \ac{SISO} model operating at \me{10} dB \ac{SNR} with \me{K = 3} users sharing \me{N = 3} sub-channel resources. The number of packets waiting at the transmitter for each user is given by \me{Q_k = 5,8} and \me{6} bits respectively. 

Fig. \ref{tbl-1} plots the sub-channel wise channel seen by the users followed by the assigned rates over each sub-channel by three different algorithms, \ac{Q-WSRME} allocation, \ac{JSFRA} approach and the band-wise \ac{Q-WSRM} scheme using \ac{WMMSE} precoder design proposed in \cite{wmmse_shi}. The performance metric used for the comparison of different algorithms is the total number of backlogged bits left over at each slot after the allocation, which is denoted by \me{\chi = \sum_{k = 1}^K \; [ Q_k - t_k ]^+}. It can be seen from Fig. \ref{tbl-1}, the \ac{Q-WSRME} scheme provides more priority to the third user with \me{Q_{3} = 6} bits as compared to the first user with \me{Q_{1} = 5} bits while allocating the first sub-channel. In contrast to the \ac{Q-WSRME} scheme, the \ac{JSFRA} approach assigns the first user on the first sub-channel thereby reducing the total number of backlogged packets waiting at the transmitter.

In order to understand the behavior in a \ac{MIMO} framework, we consider a system with \me{N=3} sub-channels and \me{N_B = 3} \acp{BS}, each equipped with \me{N_T = 4} transmit antennas operating at \me{10}dB \ac{SNR}, serving \me{|\mc{U}_b| = 3} users each. The path loss between the \acp{BS} and the users are uniformly generated from \me{[0,-3]} dB and the association is made by selecting the \ac{BS} with lower path loss. Fig. \ref{fig-1} shows the performance of the centralized schemes for a single receive antenna system. It compares the total number of \ac{SCA} updates required by the \ac{JSFRA}, \ac{SRA} and the \ac{Q-WSRME} schemes to perform the optimal allocations to minimize the total number of backlogged packets.

In the sub-channel wise allocations, where the total transmit power is shared equally among the sub-channels, the precoders are designed for each sub-channels independently. In this approach, the precoders are coupled via the number of queued bits which are updated using \eqref{eqn-weight} before designing the precoders for the sub-channels. At each \ac{SCA} points, the number of queued bits are reduced significantly with the introduction of a new sub-channel since the algorithm starts with a random initial point before it converges to an optimal\footnote{due to the nonconvex nature of the original problem} precoders. The total number of backlogged bits at each \ac{SCA} update instant are plotted in Fig. \ref{fig-1} for the discussed centralized schemes and the convergence point are marked with the data tips. Fig. \ref{fig-2} compares the performance of the centralized algorithms for the \me{N_R = 2} receive antennas. In all the schemes, the receive beamformers are updated at the \ac{SCA} update points instead of updating after the \ac{SCA} convergence as in Algorithm. \ref{algo-1}. Since the receiver minimizes the objective for the fixed transmit precoders, the convergence is monotonic as can be seen from the figures.

The behavior of the \ac{JSFRA} algorithm for different exponents \me{q} are outlined in the Table. \ref{tbl-3} for the users located at the cell-edge of the system employing \me{N_T = 4} transmit antennas. The configuration is mentioned in the caption of Table. \ref{tbl-3} along with the number of queued bits for each user. It is evident that the algorithm minimizes the queued bits for the \me{\ell_1} norm compared to the \me{\ell_2} norm, which is shown in the column displaying the total number of left over packets \me{\chi} in bits. The \me{\ell_{\infty}} norm provides fair allocation of the resources by making the left over packets to be equal for all users to \me{\chi_k = 3.58} bits. The \me{\ell_{\infty}} norm provides the fair allocation by making the queued deviation equal for all the users after the current allocation irrespective of their channel gains.
