
The last mile wireless connectivity poses significant bottleneck in the overall data traffic for the interconnected networks. The main challenges in the wireless networks are due to the scarcity of the available resources either in terms of power or spectrum usage and the complexity of the receiver algorithms which are proportional to the mobile battery drain. In order to overcome the receiver complexity, \ac{OFDM} based transmissions are introduced for the wideband transmissions. To improve data rate, multiple antennas are installed at \acp{BS} and/or at user terminals to avail additional freedom in the form of spatial dimension. The inclusion of \ac{MIMO} technique in wireless networks provides higher data rate or lower outage for the same transmission power and bandwidth.

In a network with multiple \acp{BS} serving multiple users (\acs{MU}), the main driving factor for the transmission are the packets waiting at each \ac{BS} corresponding to the different users present in the network. These available packets are transmitted over the shared wireless resources subject to certain system limitations and constraints. In this work, we consider the problem of transmit design over the space-frequency resources provided by a \ac{MU-MIMO} \ac{OFDM} framework in the downlink broadcast transmission to minimize the number of queued packets. Since the space-frequency resources are shared by multiple users associated with different \acp{BS}, the problem of interest can be viewed as a resource allocation to minimize the total number of backlogged packets of all \acp{BS}.

In general, the resource allocation problems are solved by assigning a binary variable to each user indicating the presence or the absence on a particular resource. In contrast to that, we use the transmit beamformers, which are the complex vectors, as a decision variable in determining the presence or the absence of a user on a particular resource. The purpose of using the transmit beamformers for the scheduling is two fold. Firstly, it determines the transmission rate on a certain resource and secondly, by making the transmit beamformer to be a zero vector, the corresponding user will not be scheduled on a certain resource.

In order to reduce the complexity involved in the precoder design problem, linear precoding are assumed at the \acp{BS} and linear detection is used at users. The queue minimizing network optimization objective is used to design the beamformers across the coordinating \acp{BS}, since the transmissions are guided by the available backlogged packets. To achieve the best performance, we propose a joint resource allocation scheme over the space and frequency dimensions among the coordinating \acp{BS} to minimize the time that the packets stay in the queues prior to the transmission, and, hence, to avoid packet drops as an indirect objective.

The queue minimizing precoder designs are closely related to the \ac{WSRM} problem with additional rate constraints determined by the number of backlogged packets for each user in the system (see Section \ref{sec-3} for further discussions). The topics on \ac{MIMO} \ac{BC} precoder design have been studied extensively with different performance criteria in the literature. Due to the nonconvex nature of most, if not all, linear \ac{MIMO} \ac{BC} precoder design problems, the \ac{SCA} method has gradually become a powerful tool to deal with these problems. For example, in \cite{sin_algorithm}, the nonconvex part of the objective is linearized around an operating point in order to solve the \ac{WSRM} problem in an iterative manner. Similar approach of solving the \ac{WSRM} problem via arithmetic-geometric inequality is proposed in \cite{tran2012fast}.

The connection between the achievable capacity and the \ac{MSE} for the received symbol by using the fixed \ac{MMSE} receivers as shown in \cite{viswanath1999optimal,mse_duality} is also used to solve the \ac{WSRM} problem. In \cite{christensen2008weighted,wmmse_shi}, the \ac{WSRM} problem is reformulated via \ac{MSE}, casting the problem as a convex one for fixed \ac{MMSE} receivers. In this way, the original problem is expressed in terms of the \ac{MSE} weight, precoders, and decoders. Then the problem is solved using an alternating optimization method, i.e., finding a set of variables while the remaining others are fixed. Additional rate constraints based on the \ac{QoS} requirements are included in the \ac{WSRM} problem are solved via \ac{MSE} reformulation in \cite{kaleva2013primal}.

The problem of precoder design for the \ac{MIMO} \ac{BC} system are solved either by using a centralized controller or by using decentralized algorithms where each BS handles their own problems and exchange limited information via backhaul. The distributed approaches are based on the primal or dual decomposition \cite{palomar2006tutorial,boyd2011distributed}. In primal decomposition, the so-called coupling interference variables are fixed for the subproblem at each \ac{BS} to find the optimal precoders. The fixed interference are then updated by using the subgradient method as discussed in \cite{pennanen2011decentralized}. The dual approach controls the distributed subproblems by fixing the \emph{`interference price'} for each \ac{BS} as detailed in \cite{tolli2011decentralized}.

By adjusting the weights properly, we can find arbitrary rate-tuple in the rate region of the system that maximizes other performance measures by solving the resulting WSRM problem. For example, if the weight of each user is set to be inversely proportional to his/her data rate, the corresponding problem guarantees fairness among users. As an approximate method, we may assign weights based on the current queue size of users. More specifically, the queue states can be incorporated to traditional weighted sum rate objective $\sum_k w_k R_k$ by replacing the weight $w_k$ with the corresponding queue state $Q_k$ or a function of it,  which is the outcome of minimizing the Lyapunov drift between the current and the future queue states \cite{tassiulas,neely2010stochastic}. In the backpreassure algorithm, the differential queues between the source and the destination nodes are used as the weights scaling the transmission rate \cite{georgiadis2006resource}.

Earlier studies on the queue minimization problem was summarized in the survey paper \cite{berry2004cross}. In particular, the problem of power allocation to minimize the number of backlogged packets was considered in \cite{qps_cioffi} by geometric programming formulations. Since the problem considered in \cite{qps_cioffi} assumed single antenna transmitters and receivers, the queue minimizing problem reduces to the one of optimal power allocation. In the context of wireless networks, the backpreassure algorithm mentioned above was extended in \cite{weeraddana2011resource} by formulating the corresponding user queues as the weights in the \ac{WSRM} problem.

In this paper, we consider the problem of precoder design across the space-frequency resources to minimize the total number of queued packets of all \acp{BS}. For this highly nonconvex problem, we first propose two centralized methods. In the first method, we relax the nonconvex constraint by the first order taylor approximation around an operating point, which is updated in an iterative manner until convergence or to a certain accuracy. In the second method, we reformulate the \ac{JSFRA} problem using the \ac{MSE} equivalence with the rate expression to solve for the optimal precoders. For distributed implementation, we further proposed decentralized approaches based on primal and \ac{ADMM} scheme to identify the precoders independently across the \acp{BS} by exchanging limited information via backhaul. We also proposed an iterative algorithm by solving the \ac{KKT} equations, which can be implemented easily in a distributed manner.

The remainder of this paper is as follows. In Section \ref{sec-2-3.2}, we introduce the system model and the problem formulation for the queue minimizing precoder design. Existing and the proposed precoder designs for the \ac{JSFRA} problem are presented in Section \ref{sec-3}. The distributed solutions are provided in Section \ref{sec-4} followed by the simulation results in Section \ref{sec-5}. Conclusions are drawn in Section \ref{sec-6}.
