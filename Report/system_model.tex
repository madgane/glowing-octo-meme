We consider a downlink \ac{MIMO} \ac{BC} scenario in an \ac{OFDM} framework with \me{N} sub-channels and \me{N_B} \acp{BS} each equipped with \me{N_T} transmit antennas, serving \me{K} users each with \me{N_R} receive antennas. The set of users associated with \ac{BS} \me{b} is denoted by \me{\mathcal{U}_b} and the set \me{\mathcal{U}} represents all users in the system, i.e., \me{\mathcal{U} =\underset{b\in \mathcal{B}}{\cup }\mathcal{U}_b}, where the set \me{\mathcal{B}} holds the coordinating \acp{BS}. The serving \ac{BS} of user \me{k} is denoted by \me{b_k\in \mathcal{B}}. We denote by \me{\mathcal{C} = \set{1,2,\dotsc,N}} the set of all sub-channel indices available in the system.

In this paper we adopt linear beamforming technique at \acp{BS}. Specifically, the data symbols \me{d_{l,k,n}} for  user \me{k} on the \me{l^\mathrm{th}} spatial stream over the sub-channel \me{n} is multiplied with the beamformer \me{\mvec{m}{l,k,n} \in \mathbb{C}^{N_T \times 1}} for transmission.   In order to detect  multiple spatial streams at the receiver, a receive beamforming vector \me{\mvec{w}{l,k,n}} is employed at each user. Consequently, the received signal of the \me{l^\mathrm{th}} spatial stream over sub-channel \me{n^\mathrm{th}} at user $k$ is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eqn-1}
y_{l,k,n} = \mvec{w}{l,k,n}^\herm \mvec{H}{b_k,k,n} \,\mvec{m}{l,k,n} d_{l,k,n} + \mvec{w}{l,k,n}^\herm \sum_{i \in \mc{U} \backslash \set{k}} \mvec{H}{b_i,k,n} \sum_{j = 1}^L \mvec{m}{j,i,n}d_{j,i,n} + \mvec{w}{l,k,n}^\herm \mvec{n}{k,n}
\end{equation}
where \me{\mvec{H}{b,k,n} \in \mathbb{C}^{N_R \times N_T}} with rank \me{L = \min(N_R,N_T)} is the channel between the \ac{BS} \me{b} and  user \me{k} on the sub-channel \me{n}, and \me{\mvec{n}{k,n}} \me{\sim \mc{CN}(0,N_0)} is the additive noise vector for the user \me{k} on the \me{n^\mathrm{th}} sub-channel and \me{l^\mathrm{th}} spatial stream. Assuming  \me{||\mvec{w}{l,k,n}||_{2}^{2} = 1} and independent detection of data streams, we can write the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SINR}
\gamma_{l,k,n} = \dfrac{\left |\mvec{w}{l,k,n}^\herm \, \mvec{H}{b_k,k,n} \, \mvec{m}{l,k,n} \right |^2}{N_0 + \sum_{(j,i) \neq (l,k)} |\mvec{w}{l,k,n}^\herm \mvec{H}{b_i,k,n} \mvec{m}{j,i,n} |^2}.
\end{equation}
With the infinite buffer model assumption, let \me{Q_k} be the number of backlogged packets which are destined for the user \me{k} at a given scheduling instant. The queue dynamics of the user \me{k} are modeled using the Poisson arrival process with the average packet arrivals of \me{A_k = \mathbf{E}_i\{\lambda_k\}} packets/bits, where \me{\lambda_k(i) \sim \mathrm{Pois}(A_k)} represents the instantaneous number of packets or bits arriving for the user \me{k} at the \me{{i}^\mathrm{th}} instant. The total number of queued packets at the \me{{i}^\mathrm{th}} instant for the user \me{k} depend on the fresh arrivals at the \me{{i}^\mathrm{th}} instant and the total number of backlogged packets \me{Q_k(i-1)} as given by
\begin{equation}
Q_k(i) = \Big [ Q_k(i-1) - t_k(i-1) \Big ]^+ + \lambda_k(i),
\label{eqn-2a}
\end{equation}
where \me{t_k} denote the transmissions in bits and \me{[x]^+ = \max{ \lbrace x,0  \rbrace}}. The total number of transmitted bits for the user \me{k} is given by \me{t_k(i) = \sum_{n = 1}^N \, \sum_{l = 1}^L \, t_{l,k,n}(i)},
where \me{t_{l,k,n}} is the total number of bits that can be transmitted over \me{l^\mathrm{th}} spatial stream and on \me{n^\mathrm{th}} sub-channel at the \me{i^\mathrm{th}} instant. Note that the units of \me{t_k} and \me{Q_k} are in bits defined per channel use.
