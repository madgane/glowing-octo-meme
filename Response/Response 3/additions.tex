In summary, the revised manuscript includes the following changes.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We have rewritten Appendix A-D to discuss the stationarity of limit points of the sequence of beamformer iterates generated by the centralized algorithms.
	\item We have updated the convergence of distributed algorithm to reflect the same.
\end{enumerate}

In order to discuss the convergence of the sequence of iterates generated by the centralized scheme in Algorithm 1, we use an unified superscript index \eqn{t} to represent both \ac{AO} index \eqn{i} and \ac{SCA} indexing \eqn{k}. By doing so, we represent iterate \eqn{\mbf{x}^{t}} as the solution variable produced by the iterative algorithm in every \ac{SCA} \eqn{k} and \ac{AO} step {i}. Using this notation, we have revised our convergence discussions in Appendices A-C and A-D.
