\begin{enumerate}
	\item We have rewritten Appendix A-D to discuss the stationarity of limit points of the sequence of beamformer iterates generated by the proposed algorithm.
	\item We have updated the convergence of distributed algorithm to reflect the same.
	\item We included additional constraints on optimization variables to ensure compactness of feasible set in each subproblem
\end{enumerate}
